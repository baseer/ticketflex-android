What is TicketFlex?
-------------------
TicketFlex for Android is an app that allows you to easily purchase tickets to your favorite events. It also ensures that you won’t be paying other ticket sellers a premium for tickets, just because you weren’t one of the early birds. TicketFlex also allows you to put your ticket up for sale, as long as your price is at most equal to the original ticket’s price. So, you can feel at ease if you’re no longer able to attend the event because chances are someone will buy your ticket. When you’re at the event, you can simply show the ticket’s QR code from your Android phone and be admitted into the event – no need for printing or picking up tickets.
TicketFlex is also a very useful event organizing tool. Event organizers can view their guest list and see who has been admitted into the event and who has yet to arrive. Admitting a new arrival is as simple as scanning their QR code and pressing Admit. This also eliminates the need for a proprietary ticket-scanning device.

Motivation
----------
Organizing a large scale event such as a concert or a comedy show generally requires a method of selling tickets. The event organizers for such events generally use TicketMaster, or a similar service as their method of ticket delivery. Now, there are a couple considerations when choosing a ticket delivery method:
- *What portion of the ticket price is given to the ticket delivery service? (ie. TicketMaster)*<br />
Currently, TicketFlex is a free Android app that does not receive any portion of the ticket price.

-  *Are the tickets tied directly to the purchaser? Or is it a generic ticket that can be passed on to anyone?*<br />
In TicketFlex, the tickets are tied to the purchaser. Given a ticket QR code that identifies a ticket, the event organizers can see the person’s name that is associated with that ticket. This way, the event organizer can ensure that a person’s ticket belongs to them. 

-	*If the ticket is tied to the purchaser, can the purchaser easily sell/transfer their ticket to someone else?*<br />
In TicketFlex, a user can easily sell their ticket to someone else within the app. However, the price that they set cannot be more than the original ticket price. By enforcing such an upper bound on ticket prices, we prevent ticket scalping. People can no longer buy tens (or hundreds) of tickets simply for the purposes of reselling them at a higher price.<br />
So, when it comes to avoiding ticket scalping, TicketFlex brings the best of both worlds – tickets can’t be sold for more than the original price, while at the same time, you can still sell your ticket for legitimate purposes (if for example, you can no longer attend the event).<br />
Moreover, since the user-to-user ticket purchase is done within the app, there is no risk of ending up with a fake ticket, and there is no hassle in having to organize a meeting time and place where you can get the ticket from the seller.
As described above, TicketFlex introduces some fresh and exciting features that aren’t currently offered in many ticket delivery systems.
